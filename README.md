The project I made is a portfolio website, a place where I showcase my previous projects and provides a way for people to contact me to discuss about new work opportunities. It is a simple website with navigation, built with the following technologies:
- HTML 
- CSS 
  + CSS variables
  + Flexbox
  + CSS Grid
  + Media queries for responsiveness
